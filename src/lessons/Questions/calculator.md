# Make a Simple Calculator

> **Note:** Before attempting this question, ensure you have completed the lesson on [Basic Input/Output](https://coderswiki.vercel.app/DSA/input_output.html).

In this exercise, you will create a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator will take two numbers as input from the user and then ask which operation to perform. Finally, it will display the result.

## Problem Statement

Write a program that:
1. Prompts the user to input two numbers.
2. Asks the user to choose an operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
3. Performs the chosen operation and displays the result.

## Requirements

- Use basic input/output operations as described in the previous lesson.
- Handle division carefully to avoid dividing by zero.
- Allow the user to choose between four operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`.

## Sample Interaction

Below is an example of how your program should interact with the user:

```
Enter the first number: 8
Enter the second number: 4
Choose an operation (+, -, *, /): /
Result: 2
```

## Implementation in Different Languages

Try implementing the calculator in the programming language of your choice: C++, Java, or Python. Remember to use the input and output methods you learned in the previous lesson.

- **C++:** Use `cin` for input and `cout` for output.
- **Java:** Use `Scanner` for input and `System.out.println` for output.
- **Python:** Use `input()` for input and `print()` for output.

Good luck!
