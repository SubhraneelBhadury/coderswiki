## What is Programming?

Programming is a way for us to tell computers what to do. Computer is a very dumb machine and it only does what we tell it to do. Hence we learn programming and tell computers to do what we are very slow at - computation. If I ask you to calculate 5+6, you will immediately say 11. How about 23453453 X 56456?

You will start searching for a calculator or jump to a new tab to calculate the same. This 100 days of code series will help you learn python from starting to the end. We will start from 0 and by the time we end this course, I promise you will be a Job ready Python developer!


## What is Python?

Python is a dynamically typed, general purpose programming language that supports an object-oriented programming approach as well as a functional programming approach. (Too many big words? Don't worry! We'll explore everything.)

Python is an interpreted and a high-level programming language. (We will get to that later)

It was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1989.

Python is considered one of the most beginner friendly programming languages.

## Why Python?

Question arises why Python and not some other more widely used language like C++. Well, it has its perks:-

- Python is simple and easy to understand.(The language is almost human in fact)
- It is Interpreted and platform-independent which makes debugging very easy. Debugging means checking for any errors in the code before running it.
- Python is an open-source programming language. (The code that you write can be easily and "Openly" be used and modified by anyone else. Hence, Open-Source)
- Python provides very big library support. Some of the popular libraries include NumPy, Tensorflow, Selenium, OpenCV, etc.
- It is possible to integrate other programming languages within python.

**So, everyone! Hope you are feeling interested and excited to explore the incredible world of Programming with arguably the most beginner friendly langauge called Python :). All the best! And see you in the next lesson.**
